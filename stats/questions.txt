Que :- What do you understand by Expectation of random variale ?

Sol :- The expectation of a random variable is a fundamental concept in probability theory. It represents the long-term average 
or the 'expected value' of that random variable. In simpler terms, it's a way to quantify what we can expect, on average, 
from a random process. It's calculated by summing or integrating the possible values of the random variable, 
each weighted by its probability of occurrence. 
This value helps us understand the central tendency or the average behavior of the random variable over
many repetitions of the same experiment.

Que :- What do you understand by PMF ?

Sol :- The Probability Mass Function, or PMF, of a random variable is a mathematical function that assigns probabilities to 
each possible outcome or value that the random variable can take in a discrete probability distribution. 
It tells us the likelihood of each specific outcome occurring. In other words, the PMF provides a complete probability 
distribution for a discrete random variable, allowing us to 
understand the probabilities associated with different values or events within that distribution.
(You can tell its properties to, how to check that some function is PMF or not)
