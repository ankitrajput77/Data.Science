Que :- What do you understand by Expectation of random variale ?

Sol :- The expectation of a random variable is a fundamental concept in probability theory. It represents the long-term average 
or the 'expected value' of that random variable. In simpler terms, it's a way to quantify what we can expect, on average, 
from a random process. It's calculated by summing or integrating the possible values of the random variable, 
each weighted by its probability of occurrence. 
This value helps us understand the central tendency or the average behavior of the random variable over
many repetitions of the same experiment.
