Que :- What do you understand by Expectation of random variale ?

Sol :- The expectation of a random variable is a fundamental concept in probability theory. It represents the long-term average 
or the 'expected value' of that random variable. In simpler terms, it's a way to quantify what we can expect, on average, 
from a random process. It's calculated by summing or integrating the possible values of the random variable, 
each weighted by its probability of occurrence. 
This value helps us understand the central tendency or the average behavior of the random variable over
many repetitions of the same experiment.

Que :- What do you understand by PMF ?

Sol :- The Probability Mass Function, or PMF, of a random variable is a mathematical function that assigns probabilities to 
each possible outcome or value that the random variable can take in a discrete probability distribution. 
It tells us the likelihood of each specific outcome occurring. In other words, the PMF provides a complete probability 
distribution for a discrete random variable, allowing us to 
understand the probabilities associated with different values or events within that distribution.
(You can tell its properties to, how to check that some function is PMF or not)

Que :- What do you understand by PDF ?

Sol :- The Probability Density Function, or PDF, of a random variable is a mathematical function used to describe the 
probability distribution of a continuous random variable. Unlike the Probability Mass Function (PMF) for discrete 
random variables, the PDF doesn't assign probabilities to individual values but provides a probability density across a 
range of values. Specifically, the area under the PDF curve over a given interval represents the probability of the 
random variable falling within that interval. In essence, the PDF helps us understand the relative likelihood of 
different values for a continuous random variable.

Que :- What do you understand by CDF ?

SOl :- The Cumulative Distribution Function, or CDF, of a random variable is a mathematical function that provides the cumulative probability of the random variable taking on a value less than or equal to a specific value. In other words, it gives us the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a given value. The CDF is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics and is especially useful for understanding the behavior of random variables, including both discrete and continuous ones. It helps us answer questions like 'What is the probability that the random variable is below a certain threshold?' and is a key tool in various statistical analyses and modeling tasks.
