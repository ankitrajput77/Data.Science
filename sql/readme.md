- **Describe 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF in database normalization.**
   - **Answer:**
      - **1NF (First Normal Form):** Each table has a primary key, and all attributes are atomic (no repeating groups or arrays).
      - **2NF (Second Normal Form):** All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
      - **3NF (Third Normal Form):** All attributes are functionally dependent only on the primary key.
   - **What is a subquery, and how is it different from a JOIN?**
   - **Answer:** A subquery is a query nested inside another query. A subquery can return data that will be used in the main query as a condition. A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

   - **Answer:**
```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);

```
- **What is a stored procedure in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** A stored procedure is a precompiled group of SQL statements stored in the database. It can be invoked as needed.
- **How can you handle errors in stored procedures?**
   - **Answer:** In MySQL, you can use the `DECLARE` statement to define error handlers using `CONTINUE` or `EXIT` handlers.
- **How do you prevent SQL injection in your queries?**
   - **Answer:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements, avoid constructing queries with string concatenation using external input, and always validate and sanitize user input.
- **What are `TRIGGERS` in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** Triggers are automatic actions that the database can perform when a specified change occurs (like an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation).
- **Can you explain the difference between `CHAR_LENGTH` and `LENGTH` functions?**
   - **Answer:** `CHAR_LENGTH` returns the number of characters in a string, while `LENGTH` returns the number of bytes. For single-byte character sets, they return the same value.
- **What is the purpose of the `GROUP_CONCAT` function in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** `GROUP_CONCAT` returns a concatenated string of aggregated data values for each group of rows in the result set.
- **Write a SQL query to concatenate all names from the `employees` table into a single string, separated by commas.**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(employee_name) FROM employees;

```

   - **Answer:** Transactions are a sequence of one or more SQL operations executed as a single unit. They ensure data integrity, following the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
- **How do you start and commit a transaction in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
-- SQL operations
COMMIT;

```
- **What is the difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`?**
   - **Answer:** `UNION` returns unique records from the combined dataset, while `UNION ALL` returns all records, including duplicates.
- **What are the advantages of using stored procedures?**
   - **Answer:** They provide better performance as they are precompiled, help in modular programming, offer a security mechanism, and reduce network traffic.
- **What is the difference between `DATEDIFF` and `TIMESTAMPDIFF` in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** Both are used to find the difference between two dates, but `TIMESTAMPDIFF` allows for a more specific interval, like month or year, while `DATEDIFF` returns the difference in days.
- **How do you clone a table in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS SELECT * FROM existing_table;

```
- **Write a SQL query to rank employees based on their salary in descending order.**

```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) AS ranking 
FROM employees;

```
- **How do you remove duplicate rows in a table?**
   - **Answer:** One common way is to create a new table with the distinct rows and delete the original table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS SELECT DISTINCT * FROM original_table;
DROP TABLE original_table;
RENAME TABLE new_table TO original_table;

```

   - **Answer:** A self-join is a join of a table to






- **What is the purpose of the `SET` data type in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** The `SET` type is used to store a set of strings. You can store zero or more string values chosen from a list defined at table creation time.
```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (colors SET('red', 'blue', 'green'));
INSERT INTO t1 (colors) VALUES ('red,blue');

```
- **How do you implement pagination in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** Using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`.

   - **Answer:** Using the `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()` function.
```sql
SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP(datetime_column) FROM table_name;

```
- **How can you perform a case-sensitive search in a column?**
   - **Answer:** Using the `BINARY` keyword.
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE BINARY column_name = 'Value';

```
- **How can you transpose rows into columns, and vice versa, in a query result?**
   - **Answer:** This process is known as "Pivoting". To convert rows to columns, you use a combination of aggregate functions with `CASE` statements. For the reverse, known as "Unpivoting", you can use `UNION ALL`.
```sql
-- Pivoting:
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN column = 'value1' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS 'Value1',
    SUM(CASE WHEN column = 'value2' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS 'Value2'
FROM table_name;

-- Unpivoting:
SELECT 'Value1' AS 'Column', Value1 AS 'Value' FROM table_name
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Value2' AS 'Column', Value2 AS 'Value' FROM table_name;

```

```
- **How can you optimize a MySQL query?**
   - **Answer:** Some methods include using `EXPLAIN` to analyze the query plan, indexing appropriate columns, avoiding the use of wildcard characters at the start of a `LIKE` query, and avoiding the use of `SELECT *`.
- **What is the difference between `MyISAM` and `InnoDB`?**
   - **Answer:** Major differences include:
      - `InnoDB` supports ACID-compliant transactions, whereas `MyISAM` does not.
      - `InnoDB` supports foreign key constraints, while `MyISAM` does not.
      - `MyISAM` typically offers better read performance, while `InnoDB` offers better write performance.
   - **How can you lock a table explicitly?**
   - **Answer:**

```
- **What is a correlated subquery?**
   - **Answer:** A correlated subquery is a subquery that references columns from the outer query. It's executed once for each row processed by the outer query.
```sql
SELECT column_name 
FROM table_name t1
WHERE some_value = (SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name t2 WHERE t1.id = t2.id);

```
- **How can you increase the performance of a MySQL database?**
   - **Answer:** Optimize queries using `EXPLAIN`, use indexes wisely, normalize database schema, consider hardware upgrades, and configure database parameters appropriately in `my.cnf` or `my.ini`.

```
To restore:

```bash
mysql -u username -p database_name < backup.sql

```
- **What are the different types of MySQL collations?**
   - **Answer:** Collations specify the rules for string comparison. There are various types like `utf8_general_ci`, `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`, and `latin1_general_ci`.
- **How do you find the total number of rows affected by a query?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
SELECT ROW_COUNT();

```
- **Explain the difference between `CHAR` and `VARCHAR` data types.**
   - **Answer:** `CHAR` has a fixed length, while `VARCHAR` has a variable length. For `CHAR`, unused spaces are filled with blank spaces, whereas `VARCHAR` only uses the required storage plus one or two extra bytes for the length.
- **How can you change the data type of a column in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:**

   - **Answer:** `information_schema` is a meta-database that provides detailed information about all other databases, tables, columns, indexes, constraints, etc. present in the MySQL server.
- **How can you ensure that a field value is unique across the table, other than using the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint?**
   - **Answer:** Use the `UNIQUE` constraint on the desired column.
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD UNIQUE (column_name);

```
- **How can you count the total number of tables in a database?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'your_database_name';

```
- **How can you find all the tables that have a specific column name in a database?**
   - **Answer:**

```sql
WITH CTE_Name AS (
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
)
SELECT * FROM CTE_Name;

```
**90. What is a self-join and why would you use it?**


- **Answer:** A self-join is a join where a table is joined with itself. It's useful for finding relationships within the same table.

```sql
SELECT A.column_name, B.column_name 
FROM table_name A, table_name B 
WHERE A.column_name = B.column_name;

```
**91. What are the different types of subqueries? Explain with examples.**


- **Answer:** There are three types:
- Scalar subquery: Returns a single value.

```sql
SELECT column_name 
FROM table_name 
WHERE another_column = (SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name);

```

- Row subquery: Returns a single row.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 
FROM table_name 
WHERE (column1, column2) = (SELECT column1, column2 FROM another_table WHERE condition);

```

- Table subquery: Returns a table.

```sql
SELECT column_name 
FROM (
  SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition
) AS subquery_name;

```

**92. How can you update data in one table based on data in another table?**


- **Answer:**

```sql

SET table1.column_name = table2.column_name
FROM table2
WHERE table1.another_column = table2.another_column;

```
**93. How can you retrieve a random row from a table?**


- **Answer:**

```sql
SELECT column_name FROM table_name ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1;

```
**94. What's the difference between `INNER JOIN` and `OUTER JOIN`?**


- **Answer:** `INNER JOIN` returns rows when there's a match in both tables. `OUTER JOIN` returns all rows from one table and the matching rows from the other table, filling with NULL if no match is found.

**95. How can you clone a table, including both data and schema?**


- **Answer:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS SELECT * FROM original_table;

```
**96. How do you insert multiple rows in a single SQL query?**


- **Answer:**

VALUES (value1a, value2a), 
       (value1b, value2b), 
       ...;

```
**97. Explain partitions in MySQL. How do you create them?**


- **Answer:** Partitioning divides a table into smaller, more manageable pieces, yet still being treated as a single table. It can improve performance and assist in organizing large datasets.

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
   column_name1 INT,
   column_name2 DATE
)
PARTITION BY RANGE(YEAR(column_name2)) (
   PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1991),
   PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (1995),
   PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (1999)
);

```
**98. What is the `GROUP_CONCAT` function and provide an example.**


- **Answer:** It's used to concatenate values from multiple rows into a single string.

```sql
SELECT group_column, GROUP_CONCAT(value_column)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY group_column;

```
**99. How can you prevent SQL injection in your queries?**


- **Answer:** Using parameterized queries or prepared statements. In PHP, for instance, you'd use PDO or MySQLi to bind parameters.

**100. How do you show the current SQL mode, and how can you change it?**


- **Answer:**

```sql
SELECT @@sql_mode;  -- To show
SET sql_mode = 'modes';  -- To change

```
**101. What is a transaction and how would you use it in MySQL?**


- **Answer:** Transactions group a set of tasks into a single execution unit. If one task fails, all fail. Useful for maintaining data integrity.

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO table_name1 ...;
INSERT INTO table_name2 ...;
COMMIT;  -- Or ROLLBACK;

```
**102. What are the differences between `VARCHAR` and `TEXT` data types?**


- **Answer:** While both are used to store strings, `VARCHAR` can store up to 65,535 characters and you can specify its max length, while `TEXT` can store up to 65,535 characters without specifying max length. `VARCHAR` can have a default value, but `TEXT` cannot.

**103. How do you find and fix broken foreign key constraints?**


- **Answer:** Identify them using a `LEFT JOIN` to find orphaned records, and either delete these records or update them to restore referential integrity.

**104. How do you use `FULLTEXT` indexing in MySQL?**


- **Answer:** `FULLTEXT` indexes are used for full-text searches. You can create one with:

```sql
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX index_name ON table_name(column_name);

```
Then you'd search with:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE MATCH(column_name) AGAINST('search term');

```
**105. How can you check for index fragmentation on a table and defragment it?**


- **Answer:** You can check fragmentation using `SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'table_name';` and optimize (defragment) using `OPTIMIZE TABLE table_name;`.

**106. How can you convert character sets in columns?**


- **Answer:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY column_name COLUMN_TYPE CHARACTER SET charset_name;

```
**107. How do you schedule a recurring SQL script execution in MySQL?**


- **Answer:** Using MySQL's Event Scheduler. First, ensure the scheduler is on with `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'event_scheduler';`, then create your scheduled event.

**108. What are MySQL stored procedures and how do you use them?**


- **Answer:** Stored procedures are SQL codes saved in the database to be reused. Created using `CREATE PROCEDURE`, and called via `CALL procedure_name()`.

**109. How would you monitor the performance of your MySQL database in real-time?**


- **Answer:** Tools like `SHOW PROCESSLIST`, Performance Schema, MySQL Enterprise Monitor, and third-party tools like Percona Monitoring and Management.

**110. How can you run SQL script from the command line without entering the MySQL console?**


- **Answer:** Use:

```bash
mysql -u username -p database_name < script.sql

```
**111. What is the `EXPLAIN` keyword in MySQL?**


- **Answer:** `EXPLAIN` provides a query execution plan, showing how MySQL will execute the query, which can be vital for optimization.

**112. How do you enforce a column to not accept NULL values?**


- **Answer:** By adding the `NOT NULL` constraint during table creation or modification.

**113. How do you rename a database in MySQL?**


- **Answer:** MySQL does not have a straightforward command to rename a database. Instead, one common approach is to dump the database, create a new one with the desired name, and then restore the dumped database into the new one.

**114. How can you reset the auto-increment value of a column?**


- **Answer:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name AUTO_INCREMENT = value;

```
**115. How can you handle time zones in MySQL?**


- **Answer:** MySQL provides the `CONVERT_TZ()` function to convert datetime values across time zones. Additionally, `SET time_zone = timezone;` sets the time zone for the current session.

**116. How do you retrieve only a specified number of characters from a string column?**


- **Answer:**

```sql
SELECT LEFT(column_name, number_of_chars) FROM table_name;

```
**117. What are views in MySQL and why are they used?**


- **Answer:** Views are virtual tables based on the result set of an SQL statement. They encapsulate the SQL statement and present data in a simplified manner, ensuring data abstraction, protection, and to represent a subset of the data.

**118. How do you find the second highest value in a column?**


- **Answer:**

```sql
SELECT MAX(column_name) 
FROM table_name 
WHERE column_name NOT IN (SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name);

```
These questions should serve well for interviews at product-based companies that expect a deep understanding of MySQL.
