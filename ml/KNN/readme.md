# KNN 
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple and widely used supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
- It's a non-parametric and instance-based learning algorithm, which means it doesn't make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution and makes predictions based on the similarity between data points.
- KNN is relatively easy to understand and implement, making it a popular choice for beginners in machine learning.

## Basic Idea
- The core idea behind KNN is to classify a data point based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors.
- In the case of regression, it predicts a continuous value based on the average or weighted average of the values of its nearest neighbors.

## Parameters:
- K (Number of Neighbors): K is a hyperparameter that you need to specify before using KNN. It determines the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making predictions. You can choose K based on cross-validation or other optimization techniques.

## Algorithm Steps:
1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset containing labeled data points. Each data point has a set of features and a corresponding class label (for classification) or target value (for regression).

2. Distance Calculation: Choose an appropriate distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, cosine similarity) to measure the similarity between data points. The most common distance metric in KNN is the Euclidean distance. For two data points, A and B, with n features, the Euclidean distance.

3. Normalization (Optional): It's often a good practice to normalize the features to have a similar scale. This prevents features with large ranges from dominating the distance calculations.

4. Training: KNN doesn't have a traditional training phase. Instead, it simply stores the entire dataset in memory.

## Prediction:

- For Classification: Given a new data point, calculate the distance to all data points in the training dataset and select the K-nearest neighbors with the smallest distances.
- For Regression: Find the K-nearest neighbors as described above. Then, predict the target value for the new data point as the mean (for simple KNN) or weighted mean (for weighted KNN) of the target values of the K-nearest neighbors.
- Majority Vote (Classification): In the classification task, the algorithm assigns the class label that is most common among the K-nearest neighbors to the new data point.

## Choosing K:
- Choosing an appropriate value for K is crucial. A small K (e.g., K=1) can lead to noisy predictions, while a large K can lead to overly smoothed decision boundaries. The choice of K depends on the dataset and the problem at hand. You can use techniques like cross-validation to determine the best K value.

## Pros and Cons of KNN:
- Pros:
- Simple to understand and implement.
- Works well for small to medium-sized datasets.
- No training phase, which makes it computationally efficient during training.
- Non-parametric, which means it can handle complex decision boundaries.
- Cons:
- Computationally expensive during prediction, especially for large datasets.
- Sensitive to the choice of K and the distance metric.
- Not suitable for high-dimensional data (curse of dimensionality).
- Requires sufficient data to make accurate predictions.
In summary, K-Nearest Neighbors is a versatile algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It's especially useful when you have a small to medium-sized dataset and don't want to make strong assumptions about the data distribution. However, it's important to carefully select the value of K and the distance metric to achieve good results.
